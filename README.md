# Advent of Code in Golang

This repository contains my Golang solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenges.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual programming event featuring daily coding puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. These puzzles are designed for various skill levels and can be solved in any programming language.

## Goal

My goal in participating in Advent of Code is to:

- Improve my problem-solving skills.
- Enhance my Golang programming abilities.
- Engage in a fun and educational coding challenge during the holiday season.

## Running the Solutions

To run my Golang solutions, execute the respective Go source file using the `go run` command:

```bash
go run solution.go
```

Ensure that the required input data is available in the `input.txt` file in the same directory.
